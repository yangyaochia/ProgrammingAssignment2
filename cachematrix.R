## Write a short comment describing this function
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

    i <- NULL
    # four different methods for makeCacheMatrix object
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        i <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setmean <- function(inv) i <<- inv
    getmean <- function() i
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    # x is a makeCacheMatrix object, so it has getinverse method, so as others.
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}
